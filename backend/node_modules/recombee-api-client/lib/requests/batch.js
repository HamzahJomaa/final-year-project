/**
 * In many cases, it may be desirable to execute multiple requests at once. For example, when synchronizing the catalog of items in a periodical manner, you would have to execute a sequence of thousands of separate POST requests, which is very ineffective and may take a very long time to complete. Most notably, network latencies can make execution of such sequence very slow and even if executed in multiple parallel threads, there will still be unreasonable overhead caused by the HTTP(s). To avoid the mentioned problems, batch processing may be used, encapsulating a sequence of requests into a single HTTPS request.
 * Batch processing allows you to submit arbitrary sequence of requests and the batch may combine different types of requests arbitrarily as well.
 * Note that the status code of the batch request itself is 200 even if the individual requests result in error â€“ you have to inspect the code values in the resulting array.
